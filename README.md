# Blog Project 📘

A modern and responsive full-stack web application that simulates a blog platform. Developed as both a personal and academic project to solidify full-stack web development skills using the **MERN** stack. The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) articles, including image uploads, all within a clean and interactive UI.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Creating dynamic, content-driven platforms is a common requirement in web development. This project addresses that challenge by building a **blog-style application** from scratch, with features like content creation, search, image upload, and responsive design. It also emphasizes clean architecture using the **MVC pattern** on the backend and a **RESTful API** for structured client-server interaction.
